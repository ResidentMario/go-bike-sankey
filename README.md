# go-bike-sankey

This repository contains code, data inputs, data outputs, and hand-crafted poster files showing bicycle route volumes in (1) San Francisco and (2) the East Bay (two parts of the Ford Go Bike system; the third leg is in San Jose).

To see the project outputs and download the posters for yourself see [my blog post about this project](http://www.residentmar.io/2019/01/15/ford-go-bike-maps.html).

To reproduce this visualization for the bikeshare system in your own hometown see the code in `go-bike-sankey.ipynb`. More instructions coming eventually; maybe try pinging me to write them. :)
